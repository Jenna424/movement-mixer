Movement Mixer Sinatra CRUD app allows users to design and manage custom, personalized workout routines
by implementing the following functionality:

1). Users can create and log in to their own individual accounts.
2). Logged-in users can design personalized workout plans that comprise several exercise movements.
3). Alternatively, users can create their own exercises to include in a particular workout routine at a later time.
4). A user can view the index of all workout routines, as well as the index of all exercise movements.
5). A user can view all routines designed by a specific user to gain inspiration for his/her own workout plans.
6). A user can include exercise movements created by other users in his/her own workout plan.
7). However, users can only edit and delete routines and movements that they themselves have created.
